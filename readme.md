This is the fourth homework for KIEI-451: a web page showing a population of rideshare rides. The assignment demonstrates the use of built-in and custom functions, loops, and conditional logic.

noober.js uses loops and conditional logic to identify the appropriate level of service and rider information for each ride and leg, and inserts appropriately formatted HTML into index.html.
